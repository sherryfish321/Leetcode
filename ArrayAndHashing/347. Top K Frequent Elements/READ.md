**347. Top K Frequent Elements**  
Link: [Top K Frequent Elements](https://neetcode.io/problems/top-k-elements-in-list?list=neetcode150)  
Difficulty: Medium  
Topics: 

=======================================================================================

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements within the array.

The test cases are generated such that the answer is always unique.

You may return the output in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2

Output: [2,3]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1

Output: [7]
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^4.
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= number of distinct elements in nums.

UMPIRE Method:

Understand
> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
- Will the length of the string in a list be different?  
- Is there any time or space complexity requirement? 

Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category
- 

Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram
- First idea:
1. 

- Improved idea:
1. 

Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution


Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
