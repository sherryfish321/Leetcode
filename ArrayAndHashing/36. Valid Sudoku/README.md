=======================================================================================

You are given a 9 x 9 Sudoku board board. A Sudoku board is valid if the following rules are followed:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without duplicates.
Return true if the Sudoku board is valid, otherwise return false

Note: A board does not need to be full or be solvable to be valid.

Example 1:

Input: board = 
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","8",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: true
Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["1","2",".",".","3",".",".",".","."],
 ["4",".",".","5",".",".",".",".","."],
 [".","9","1",".",".",".",".",".","3"],
 ["5",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","4"],
 [".",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","5"],
 ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
 [".",".",".",".",".",".","2",".","."],
 [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","8"],
 [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: false
Explanation: There are two 1's in the top-left 3x3 sub-box.

Constraints:

board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

UMPIRE Method:

Understand
> - Ask clarifying questions and use examples to understand what the interviewer wants out of this problem.
> - Choose a “happy path” test input, different than the one provided, and a few edge case inputs.
> - Verify that you and the interviewer are aligned on the expected inputs and outputs.
- Can the input array be empty?
- Is there any time or space complexity requirement?
- If different numbers have the same frequency, and count is bigger than k. What should I return in this situation.

Match
> - See if this problem matches a problem category (e.g. Strings/Arrays) and strategies or patterns within the category
- 

Plan
> - Sketch visualizations and write pseudocode
> - Walk through a high-level implementation with an existing diagram
- First idea:
1.


- Improved idea:
1. 

Review
> - Re-check that your algorithm solves the problem by running through important examples
> - Go through it as if you are debugging it, assuming there is a bug

Evaluate
> - Finish by giving space and run-time complexity
> - Discuss any pros and cons of the solution


Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
